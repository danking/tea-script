Features
 - [ ] +,-,/,*, etc. should probably translate into their JS equivalent
       primops instead of functions

Failures
 - [ ] make-uid does not concern itself with Unicode - it might not need to...
 - [ ] I don't have any tests for js-data.rkt or tea-data.rkt's dispatchers
 - [ ] no support for unquote or unquote-slicing

Goals
 - [ ] Support for full programs (multiple expressions)
 - [X] Sane way to access the `dot' opreator
 - [ ] Sane way to access the `[]' opreator (probably by taking on extra
       functionality to tea-send
